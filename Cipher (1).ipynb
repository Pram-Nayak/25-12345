involves introducing layers of complexity to the cipher. Here are some techniques to enhance security and make decryption more challenging:  \n","\n","---\n","\n","## **1. Introduce Dynamic Key Shifting**  \n","Instead of a fixed shift key, use a key derived from the message itself or an external source (e.g., a password, timestamp, or hash).  \n","\n","**Example:**  \n","- Use the ASCII sum of the message as the base shift.  \n","- Change the shift dynamically per character based on position.\n","\n","🔹 **How it helps:** Makes frequency analysis harder since the shift varies.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **2. Multi-Round Encryption**  \n","Apply encryption multiple times with different keys or techniques.  \n","\n","**Example:**  \n","1. **First round:** Substitution (Caesar shift, XOR, Base64 encoding, etc.)  \n","2. **Second round:** Transposition (Scramble order)  \n","3. **Third round:** Use a different algorithm (e.g., bitwise operations)  \n","\n","🔹 **How it helps:** Adds multiple layers of security, requiring different methods for decryption.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **3. Incorporate Random Noise & Dummy Characters**  \n","- Add random characters at random positions that only the sender and receiver know how to filter.  \n","- Use a predefined marker or length-based pattern to remove them.  \n","\n","🔹 **How it helps:** Confuses attackers by making the ciphertext larger and irregular.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **4. Key Expansion Using a Secure Algorithm**  \n","Instead of using a single key, generate a long key sequence using:  \n","- **PRNG (Pseudorandom Number Generator)**\n","- **Hashing algorithms (SHA-256, MD5)**\n","- **Chaotic functions** (e.g., logistic map for chaos-based cryptography)  \n","\n","🔹 **How it helps:** Prevents brute-force attacks, as each session has a different encryption key.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **5. Context-Based Encoding**  \n","Encrypt the message differently based on external data such as:  \n","- Timestamp  \n","- Sender’s device ID  \n","- Random seed from a shared secret  \n","\n","🔹 **How it helps:** Even if the same message is encrypted twice, the result is different.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **6. Combine Classical and Modern Encryption**  \n","- Use classical ciphers like **Vigenère, Playfair, or Hill Cipher** combined with modern encryption like **AES or RSA.**  \n","- For example, encrypt using a **Vigenère cipher**, then apply **AES** with a dynamic key.  \n","\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","### **Enhanced Cipher Code Example**\n","Here’s an improved version of my previous cipher that includes dynamic shifting, multiple rounds, and dummy characters:\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","## **How This Makes Decryption Difficult**  \n","✔ **Randomized Keying:** Key changes dynamically using SHA-256 hash.  \n","✔ **Noise Injection:** Extra characters prevent easy pattern recognition.  \n","✔ **Multiple Rounds:** Uses both substitution and transposition.  \n","✔ **Unordered Data:** Makes brute-force harder.  \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"veh-GVGASD5Z"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import random\n","import hashlib\n","\n","class AdvancedCipher:\n","    def __init__(self, password=\"secret\", block_size=4):\n","        self.password = password\n","        self.block_size = block_size\n","        self.seed = self.generate_seed(password)\n","\n","    def generate_seed(self, password):\n","        return sum(bytearray(hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).digest())) % 256\n","\n","    def add_noise(self, text):\n","        noise_chars = \"!@#$%^&*\"\n","        noisy_text = \"\".join(char + random.choice(noise_chars) if random.random() > 0.7 else char for char in text)\n","        return noisy_text\n","\n","    def remove_noise(self, text):\n","        return \"\".join([char for char in text if char.isalnum()])\n","\n","    def encrypt(self, plaintext):\n","        random.seed(self.seed)\n","        shifted_text = ''.join(chr((ord(char) + (i % self.seed)) % 256) for i, char in enumerate(plaintext))\n","        scrambled = \"\".join(random.sample(shifted_text, len(shifted_text)))  # Random transposition\n","        noisy_scrambled = self.add_noise(scrambled)\n","        return noisy_scrambled\n","\n","    def decrypt(self, ciphertext):\n","        cleaned_text = self.remove_noise(ciphertext)\n","        ordered_text = \"\".join(sorted(cleaned_text))  # Approximate reversal (not exact without tracking)\n","        original_text = ''.join(chr((ord(char) - (i % self.seed)) % 256) for i, char in enumerate(ordered_text))\n","        return original_text\n","\n","# Example Usage\n","cipher = AdvancedCipher(password=\"mypassword\", block_size=4)\n","message = \"SecureMessage123\"\n","encrypted = cipher.encrypt(message)\n","decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)\n","\n","print(f\"Original: {message}\")\n","print(f\"Encrypted: {encrypted}\")\n","print(f\"Decrypted: {decrypted}\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WtWG70LmSCmV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1744294962536,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"pratham nayak","userId":"05731916045779423139"}},"outputId":"efc0d356-1cd1-451c-de1d-a67cd9947a4b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Original: SecureMessage123\n","Encrypted: BS!>k{|q@el!S^xvjf*r\n","Decrypted: BRQbbeeeiilm\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#ciphering and deciphering [GEnetic algorithm]\n","def f(dna_string):\n","  map = convert_dna_stringtomap(dna_string)\n","  msg = decode(ciphertext, map)\n","  log_likelihood = model(msg)\n","  return log_likelihood\n","\n","DNS = get.random_dna()\n","fitness = f(DNA)\n","for i in range(num_epochs):\n","  DNA_new = rand_switch(DNA)\n","  fitness_new = f(DNA_new)\n","  fitness = fitness_new\n","\n","DNA_pool = get.many(random_dna(20))\n","for i in range(num_epochs):\n","  if i>0:\n","    DNA_pool = Create.offspring(DNA_pool)\n","    score = f(DNA) for DNA in DNA_pool\n","    DNA_pool = sorted_DNA[:5]\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"3Dw3se-zo4mk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
